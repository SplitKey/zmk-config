This was intially provided to me by KeySplit ( https://keysplit.store/ ) I have used a Corne with the colemak-dh layout for about 3 months when I fried my board. I accedential pulled the TRRS cable and 3 keys burnt out, and I was unable to identify how to fix it. After gaining some expeirence with the corne, I knew somethings I really wanted in a keyboard. I was looking for a readable screen, less finger movement by elimenating the 6th row, and a larger offset for my pinkie. I made my corne so I was confident I would be able to solder and program the chocfi, but I didn't want to spend the time since I was back to a QWERTY board. The team at keysplit makes a killer looking board, and afgter speaking with Ivan I was all in. ZMK is new to me so I asked them to provide me with the original code they flashed for my colemak layout. They sent me this code on github, and I saw it as a great start to learning how to use this tool.

Features of Chocofi:

Split keyboard with 3 rows, 5 columns, and 3 thumbs per half
36-key low profile split keyboard
Increased pinky column stagger
Inspired by Fifi keyboard
Pro Micro compatible footprint (USB-C, nice!nano for wireless)
With Kailh Choc v1 Hotswap sockets
White Kailh switches
The PCB is modified to have a on-board power switch for battery management (good for wireless build).
